# FFHSAppointmentsExporter
To export the calendar, go to [Veranstaltungs- & Pr√ºfungstermine](https://students.ffhs.ch/campus/#!app/smartdesign.campus.appointment) and click on `Meine Termine`.
Now you can open up the developer tools and paste the script in `AppointmensExporterGoogle.js` into the console. It should download a CSV that you can import into Google Calendar.
